        The Python Nairobi User Group is a community of software developers and
        enthusiasts in Nairobi, Kenya, who are passionate about the Python
        programming language. As a group, we strive to share knowledge, ideas,
        and best practices in the Python ecosystem, and promote its adoption and
        growth in the local tech industry.
      </p>
      <p className="my-6 text-muted-foreground ">
        Our group meets monthly to discuss various topics related to Python,
        such as web development, scientific computing, machine learning, data
        science, automation, DevOps, and more. Discussion of frameworks,
        libraries, packages, etc. built with or on top of Python is also of
        interest to the group and we'll talk about those things too. We also
        organize speaker sessions, workshops, and hackathons to help members
        improve their Python skills and build practical applications.
